# MatrixRs

A Rust implementation of Ruby Matrix class.

I am studying Rust and I'll try to make a drop in replacement for Matrix Ruby library.

I'm fresh new to Rust so I don't know if I would be able to acomplish this.

## Roadmap

Done:
1. Add Matrix gem repository as git submodule
  - This will easy the task of keeping track with future updates
2. Run Matrix gem original test suite against MatrixRs class

OBS: Meanwhile MatrixRs is just an empty class (placeholder).
No Rust code were added yet. It just doesn't do anything!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'matrix_rs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install matrix_rs

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
